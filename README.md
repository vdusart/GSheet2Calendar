# GSheet2Calendar

## Description

This year, our course schedule comes from a shared document on Google Drive.

To make the accessibility of this calendar easier, we decided to create a script to import our class schedule into a calendar.
To do this, the script converts the class schedule document to an ics file.

## Usage

You can choose between using the ics we provide [here](https://example.com/) or deploying the script by yourself.
